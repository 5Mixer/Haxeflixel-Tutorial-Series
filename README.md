Hello! This is the repository for my Youtube channel, [Glitbit Tutorials](http://tinyurl.com/qjzh7ku). All of the code and assets I create in the episodes are publicly avaliable here for you to download, read, and study. Alot (all?) of the projects are built with the awesome Haxeflixel, an awesome Haxe library.

Feel free to fork, post an issue, anything. Think a typo iis not worth it? Do it! :)

Need to talk about something here, or need help? @5Mixer, leave an issue, leave a comment, whatever :D There is also a chatroom for anything and everything todo with my series, but tweeting me is probably faster: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Mixerman123/Haxeflixel-Tutorial-Series?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
